# Make the code more manageable and more maintainable by using classes. 
# A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined. 
# It doesnâ€™t actually contain any data. 
# An instance is an object that is built from a class and contains real data.
# Many instances can be created from a single class.

# Python class names are written in CapitalizedWords notation by convention.
# pass is often used as a placeholder
class StarcraftUnit:
    pass
# the first parameter will always be a variable called self.
# When a new class instance is created, the instance is automatically passed
# to the self parameter in .__init__() so that new attributes can be defined on the object.
# creates an attribute and assigns it the value of the selected parameter  
# Attributes created in .__init__() are called instance attributes
class StarcraftUnit:
    def __init__(self, name, sight):
        self.name = name
        self.sight = sight

# Class attributes are attributes that have the same value for all class instances. 
# You can define a class attribute by assigning a value to a variable name outside of .__init__().
# Use class attributes to define properties that should have the same value for every class instance
class StarcraftUnit:
    race = "Protoss"
    def __init__(self, name, sight):
        self.name = name
